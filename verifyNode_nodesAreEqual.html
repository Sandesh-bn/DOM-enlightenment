 two nodes are equal if and only if the following
conditions are satisfied:
• The two nodes are of the same type.
• The  following  string  attributes  are  equal:  nodeName,  localName,  namespaceURI,
prefix, and nodeValue. That is, they are both null, or they have the same length
and are identical character for character.
• The attributes NamedNodeMaps are equal. That is, they are both null, or they have
the same length and for each node that exists in one map, there is a node that exists
in the other map and is equal, although not necessarily at the same index.
• The childNodes NodeLists are equal. That is, they are both null, or they have the
same length and contain equal nodes at the same index. Note that normalization
can  affect  equality;  to  avoid  this,  nodes  should  be  normalized  before  being
compared.
Calling the isEqualNode() method on a node in the DOM will ask if that node is equal
to the node that you pass it as a parameter. 


If you don’t care about two nodes being exactly equal, and instead you
want to know whether two node references refer to the same node, you
can simply check them using the === operator (i.e., document.body ===
document.body). This will tell you if they are identical but not equal.
