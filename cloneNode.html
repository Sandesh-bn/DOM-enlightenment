            When cloning an Element node, all of its attributes and their values
            (including in-line events) are cloned as well. Anything added with ad
            dEventListener() or node.onclick is not cloned.
            You  might  think  that  cloning  a  node  and  its  children  using  clone
            Node(true) would return a NodeList, but it in fact does not.
            cloneNode() may lead to duplicate element IDs in a document.
