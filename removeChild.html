        Depending on what you are removing or replacing, simply providing
the innerHTML, outerHTML, and textContent properties with an empty
string might be easier and faster. Be careful, however, as memory leaks
in the browser might come back to haunt you.
replaceChild() and removeChild() return the replaced and removed
node, respectively. Basically, the node is not gone just because you re‚Äê
place or remove it. These actions simply take the node out of the current
live document. You still have a reference to it in memory.
